## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to look at data and trends for bike rentals from the NYC Citibike program, for the month of August, to determine if this program would be a good fit for Des Moines, Iowa. The types of data that were analyzed included the following; checkout times by user and gender, trips by weekday per hour, trips by weekday per gender, and weekday trips by male, female or unknown, subscriber and user. These factors were used to analyze if this program would be a success in a secondary location.


## Results
This graph shows the majority of users use their bike for about a half an hour, and are done by the 60 minute mark.
