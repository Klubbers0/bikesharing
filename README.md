## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to look at data and trends for bike rentals from the NYC Citibike program, for the month of August, to determine if this program would be a good fit for Des Moines, Iowa. The types of data that were analyzed included the following; checkout times by user and gender, trips by weekday per hour, trips by weekday per gender, and weekday trips by male, female or unknown, subscriber and user. These factors were used to analyze if this program would be a success in a secondary location.

**Checkout Times by Gender* This graph is similar to the first, however the data is broken down by gender, showing us that males check out bikes at a much higher rate, almost 3 times higher than females or unknown.

**Trips by Weekday per Hour** This graph shows the highest and lowest volumes of checkout times for bikes, by hour. For weekdays, mornings between 7-10am and evenings between 5-8pm are the highest, while on weekends checkout times pick up around 10am, continue throughout the day and start to teeter off around 8pm.

**User Trips by Gender by Weekday** This final graph shows the number of trips, by weekday by user type, subscribers vs customer, and is then further borken down by gender. Males have the higher amount of trips as subscribers, with the most popular days being Thursday and Friday. Females also have higher amounts of trips as subscribers, but have lower utlization than the males. 

## Summary
Overall, bike rentals were very popular for the month of August, in New York City. Over 2 million bikes were rented in one month, and many of the bike rentals occured during workday commute times. There was also a strong presence of day long weekend rentals. This data tells us that there is sustainability for a program during the week for commuters and weekends for visitors or tourists. There is also strong evidence to support that having bike subscriptions increases the usage, particularly among males. For future analysis, I would compare the data to other months, as the weather in Manhattan and Des Moies are likely similar and biking might not be as popular during the colder winter months. Weather data could also be analyzed to help with this analysis. Age of user for the bike program could also be analyzed to see what the target demographic is for a program like this.
